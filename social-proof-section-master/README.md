## 🧠 What I learned

> In this challenge, I recreated a **social proof section** showing customer reviews and rating cards.  
> I practiced combining **Grid** and **Flexbox** to manage a clean and responsive layout, while adding small **translate()** transforms to create a subtle “staggered” visual effect.  
> I also used **CSS variables** for color and typography consistency and learned to manage different assets for mobile and desktop using the `<picture>` element.  
> This project helped me improve my **layout composition**, **responsive thinking**, and attention to visual hierarchy in UI design.
