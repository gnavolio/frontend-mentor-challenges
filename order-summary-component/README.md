## 🧠 What I learned

> In this project, I recreated a clean and responsive **Order Summary Card** using HTML and CSS.  
> I practiced working with **flexbox alignment** to distribute elements horizontally and vertically inside the card.  
> I also learned how to use **inline-flex** to align icons and text within a single component and applied **CSS variables** for consistent theming.  
>  
> Additionally, I experimented with **modern viewport units** (`lvh`) to handle full-height layouts more reliably across devices, and refined hover effects for interactive elements such as buttons and links.  
>  
> This challenge helped me strengthen my understanding of **component-based CSS structure**, **responsive typography**, and **visual hierarchy** in small UI components.
